  # Viterbi Algorithm implmentation
  
This program implments Viterbi algorithm without using any high level packages that already have the algorithm to find the most probable underlying observation.

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is given for actions related to weather like walking, shopping and cleaning. The program finds the most likely weather sequence (rainy or sunny) based on the given observations in HMM.

Language Used: Python3
